# Time Series Forecasting in Stock Market Data

## Introduction
This project performs time series forecasting using stock market data from companies such as HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. The objective is to predict stock price trends using various statistical and machine learning models. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of forecasting techniques to provide insights into future stock price movements.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-forecasting.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stock-market-forecasting
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have the required dataset. You can use your own stock market dataset or access it from a service like Google Drive or Kaggle.

## Usage
1. Import the required libraries and ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade mplfinance
   ```

2. Load the stock data for analysis. You can replace the sample CSV files with your own stock data:
   ```python
   hdfc_five_min_df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/HDFCBANK_with_indicators_.csv')
   reliance_five_min_df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/RELIANCE_with_indicators_.csv')
   sunpharma_five_min_df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/SUNPHARMA_with_indicators_.csv')
   ```

3. (Optional) Perform time series decomposition using the `statsmodels` library:
   ```python
   from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
   decomposition = seasonal_decompose(hdfc_five_min_df['close'], period=12)
   decomposition.plot()
   ```

4. Apply time series forecasting models (such as ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet) to predict future stock prices. For example:
   ```python
   # Example using ARIMA model (you will need to adjust parameters based on your data)
   from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
   model = ARIMA(hdfc_five_min_df['close'], order=(5, 1, 0))
   model_fit = model.fit()
   print(model_fit.summary())
   ```

## Features
- **Stock Data Collection**: Load stock market data for various companies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract and select relevant features for better forecasting accuracy.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Decompose stock price time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
- **Forecasting Models**: Apply statistical models (like ARIMA) or machine learning methods (like LSTM) for stock price forecasting.
- **Visualization**: Visualize stock price trends and forecast results using Matplotlib and Plotly.

## Dependencies
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`
- `mplfinance`
- `statsmodels`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`

## Configuration
Adjust the following parameters in the notebook to fit your data and needs:
- **Dataset Path**: Set the path to your CSV files containing stock market data.
- **Model Parameters**: Modify the parameters for the forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA orders or LSTM architecture).
- **Visualization Settings**: Customize the plots for better presentation of results.

## Documentation
The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to process and analyze stock market data for forecasting purposes. Each section is clearly labeled, and code comments explain the functionality of different blocks.

## Examples
1. **Stock Data Import**:
   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/stock_data.csv')
   print(df.head())
   ```

2. **Time Series Decomposition**:
   ```python
   from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
   decomposition = seasonal_decompose(df['close'], period=12)
   decomposition.plot()
   ```

3. **ARIMA Model Forecasting**:
   ```python
   from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
   model = ARIMA(df['close'], order=(5, 1, 0))
   model_fit = model.fit()
   model_fit.plot_predict()
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- **Data Loading Issues**: Ensure that the CSV file paths are correct and the data has the expected structure (e.g., columns for date, close prices, etc.).
- **Model Convergence**: If the ARIMA or other models are not converging, try tuning the hyperparameters such as the order for ARIMA or the number of layers for LSTM.
- **Memory Errors**: Reduce the size of the dataset by using a smaller window or less frequent time intervals if you're running into memory limitations.
