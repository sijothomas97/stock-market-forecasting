# Handwritten Text Recognition

## Introduction
This project implements a deep learning-based approach to recognizing handwritten text using PyTorch. It leverages various machine learning techniques and libraries to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance. The project is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy configuration and adaptation to different datasets.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-text-recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd handwritten-text-recognition
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset (if using Google Colab):
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive/')
   ```

2. Ensure the dataset is properly structured and unpacked.

3. Run the notebook to start training:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Handwritten_text_recognition.ipynb
   ```

4. (Optional) Set a seed for reproducibility:
   ```python
   SEED = 1234
   random.seed(SEED)
   np.random.seed(SEED)
   torch.manual_seed(SEED)
   torch.cuda.manual_seed(SEED)
   torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
   ```

## Features
- **Model Training**: Train a deep learning model using PyTorch to recognize handwritten text.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes data loading and preprocessing steps.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using confusion matrices and other metrics.

## Dependencies
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `tqdm`
- `google.colab` (if using Google Drive)

## Configuration
You can adjust the following parameters within the notebook:
- **Dataset Path**: Specify the path to your dataset.
- **Model Parameters**: Adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, and batch size.
- **Random Seed**: Set a random seed for reproducibility.

## Documentation
The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook, providing step-by-step guidance. You can modify the cells as needed for experimentation with different datasets or model architectures.

## Examples
1. Example of mounting Google Drive and loading the dataset:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive/')
   ```

2. Example of training a model:
   ```python
   # Start training the model
   model.train()
   for epoch in range(num_epochs):
       # Training loop here
   ```

3. Example of evaluating the model:
   ```python
   # Confusion matrix evaluation
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
   ConfusionMatrixDisplay(cm).plot()
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- **Google Drive Mount Issues**: Ensure that you have the correct permissions and that the drive is properly mounted.
- **Out of Memory Errors**: Reduce the batch size if you're running into memory constraints.
